<h3>About Course</h3>
<div>
    <p> Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the
        practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web
        Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The
        challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and
        techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and
        so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is
        developing.</p>
